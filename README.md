## Website Deployment
The GitHub repo is cloned and updated on 000webhost.  The GitHub repo has no connection to the databases on 000webhost.  The GitHub repo serves as a source control, but it will not have full functionality.  The fully functional site can be accessed at: https://intro-se-group-9.000webhostapp.com/ <br>
<br>
You can clone the GitHub repo locally, but the database connection will not be functional.
